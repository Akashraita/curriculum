> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Rotate the given `numbers` list to the right by n steps. Could you solve this in-place using `O(1)` extra space?**

Sample variables to use:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
n = 4

# Result:
result = rotate_list(numbers, n)

# result should be [6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
- built-in function (`reversed`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!
