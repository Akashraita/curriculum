> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Return the wealthiest citizen from a list of bank accounts. Each person will have multiple accounts, and you need to add their accounts together to determine their total wealth.**

Sample list to use:
```python
accounts = [[2, 1, 7], [7, 5, -3], [12, -5, 1], [1, 0, 11]]

# Test the function
accounts = [[2, 1, 7], [7, 5, -3], [12, -5, 1], [1, 0, 11]]

print(return_wealthiest_citizen(accounts))
# Expected output: 12
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- order (`sorted`, `reversed`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
- built-in function (`max()`, `sum()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!
