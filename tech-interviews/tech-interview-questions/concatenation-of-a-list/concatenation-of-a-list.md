> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Write a function that takes in a `numbers` list and creates a new `nums` list of length `2x`, where `nums` is the concatenation of two `numbers` lists.**

For instance, if the input `numbers` list is `[7, 3, 7]`, the function should return `[7, 3, 7, 7, 3, 7]` (since the `nums` list is the concatenation of two `numbers` lists, and each element of the `numbers` list appears in both parts of the `nums` list).

Here is an example:

```python
numbers = [7, 3, 7]
nums = build_nums_list(numbers)

# nums should become [7, 3, 7, 7, 3, 7]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
- built-in function (`len()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!
