> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Return the nth largest element from the `numbers` list using the `n` value.**

Sample program:
```python
# Given list
numbers = [1, 4, 2, 8, 7, 5]

# Given n
n = 3

# nth Largest (3rd largest)
# 5
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- order (`sorted`, `reversed`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
