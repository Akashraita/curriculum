> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Write a function that takes in a 0-based permutation list (`ints`) and returns a `numbers` list of the same length, where `numbers[i]` is the element at index `ints[i]` in the original `ints` list.**

For instance, if the input list is `[4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5]`, the function should return `[0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5]` (since `numbers[1]` is the element at index `ints[1]` in the `ints` list, which is `0`, and so on).

A **0-based permutation** list (`ints`) is a list of distict integers from `0` to `ints.length - 1`.

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
- built-in function (`.len()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!
