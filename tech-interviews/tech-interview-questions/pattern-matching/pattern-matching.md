    # Confirm if the pattern of the given strings follow the same pattern of the pattern variable.

    # Sample program:
    pattern = 'aabbc'
    str1 = 'meow meow woof woof oink'
    str2 = 'meow woof oink'
    
    result = check_pattern(pattern, str1)

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Confirm if the pattern of the given strings follow the same pattern of the `pattern` variable.**

Example input/output:
```python
pattern = 'aabbc'
str1 = 'meow meow woof woof oink'
str2 = 'meow woof oink'

result = check_pattern(pattern, str1)
# result should be True

result = check_pattern(pattern, str2)
# result should be False
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
- built-in function (`reduce()`, `enumerate()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!
