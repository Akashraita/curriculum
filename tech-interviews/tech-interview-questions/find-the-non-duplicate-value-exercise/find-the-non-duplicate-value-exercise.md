> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Write a function that finds and returns the non-duplicate value from a `numbers` list. The function should have a linear runtime complexity.**

For instance, if the input `numbers` list is `[13, 13, 44, 44, 1, 1, 7, 7, 9]`, the function should return `9` (since `9` is the only element in the list that does not have a duplicate).

Here is an example program:

```python
numbers = [13, 13, 44, 44, 1, 1, 7, 7, 9]
non_duplicate = find_non_duplicate(numbers)

# non_duplicate should be 9
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- Bitwise opearations (`XOR`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
- built-in function
