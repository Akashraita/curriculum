> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Write a program that generates a new string list from the given `numbers` list.**

Conditions:
  - If newList[i] is divisible by both 2 and 4, you should replace the number with "I'm".
  - If newList[i] is not divisible by any number but 1 or itself (i.e. a prime number), replace it with "Enki".
  - If newList[i] is divisible by 7, replace with "with".
  - If newList[i] is divisible by both 3 and 5, replace with "coding".

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
- built-in function (`.append()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!
