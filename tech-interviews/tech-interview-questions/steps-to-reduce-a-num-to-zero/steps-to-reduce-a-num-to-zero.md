> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Return the number of steps needed to reduce a given number to 0. Rules: If the current number is even, you divide it by 2, if it is odd, you reduce it by 1.**

Sample numbers to use:
```python
num1 = 314
result1 = reduce_to_zero(num1)

# result1 should be 13

num2 = 7
result2 = reduce_to_zero(num2)

# result2 should be 5

num3 = 15
result3 = reduce_to_zero(num3)

# result3 should be 7

num4 = 555
result4 = reduce_to_zero(num4)

# result4 should be 14

```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
