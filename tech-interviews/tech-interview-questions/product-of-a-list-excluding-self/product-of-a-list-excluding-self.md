    # Implement a function product_list(numbers) that returns a new list result such that result[i] is the product of all elements in numbers excluding numbers[i]. The function should have a runtime complexity of O(n).

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Implement a function `product_list(numbers)` that returns a new list `result` such that `result[i]` is the product of all elements in `numbers` excluding `numbers[i]`. The function should have a runtime complexity of `O(n)`.**

Sample program:
```python
# Input list
numbers = [1, 3, 4, 6]

# Function
result = product_list(numbers)

# result should be [72, 24, 18, 12]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
- built-in function (`reduce()`, `enumerate()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!
