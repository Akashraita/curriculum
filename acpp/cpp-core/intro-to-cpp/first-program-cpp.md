# Let's Create Our First Program!

---

## Content

Ready for some code?

It's time to create our first program! Let's create a `"Hello, World!"` one.

`"Hello, World!"` is a simple program that prints the text `"Hello, World!"` to the screen. It is often used as a starting point when learning a new programming language.

In **C++**, you can print text to the screen using the `std::cout` object. Here is an example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}

// Hello, World!
```

To run the program, you can write the code into the **C++** console, or you can save it to a script file with the `.cpp` extension and run it using the `g++` compiler.

Save the code to a file called "hello.cpp".

In the **C++** console, type:
```cpp
g++ hello.cpp
```

You should see the text "Hello, World!" printed to the screen.
