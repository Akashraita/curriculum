# Basic Data Types in C++

---

## Content

**C++** has several basic data types, including:

### int 
---

Integers, such as 1, 2, 3
```cpp
int number = 10;
std::cout << number;
// 10
```

### double
---

Floating-point numbers, which are numbers that contain a decimal point.
```cpp
double number = 10.5;
std::cout << number; 
// 10.5
```

### char
---

A single character, such as 'a' or 'b':

```cpp
char letter = 'a';
std::cout << letter;
// a
```

### bool 

Boolean values, either `true` or `false`
```cpp
bool isTrue = true;
std::cout << std::boolalpha << isTrue;
// true
```

### string

A sequence of characters, such as "hello", "Enki", ...

```cpp
std::string greeting = "Hello, world!";
std::cout << greeting;
// Hello, world!
```
