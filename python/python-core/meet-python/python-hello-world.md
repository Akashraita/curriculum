# Hello Mars!

## Content

Let's write our first Python program!

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to use Python's `print` function to output **the first thing you'd log if you just landed on Mars**!

Here's how you would say hello to Mars:

```py
print('Hello Mars!')
```

And the output displayed in the shell would be:

```plain-text
Hello Mars!
```

## Practice

Let's practice more Python! Which statement will display `'Enki'`?

```python
???
```

- `print('Enki')`
- `: 'Enki'`
- `puts 'Enki'`
- `console.log('Enki')`


---

## Revision

Complete the code snippet with the correct function to output `'Python with Enki!'`:

```python
???('Python with Enki!')

# Output:
# Python with Enki!
```

- `print`
- `write`
- `sys.out`
- `writeln`
