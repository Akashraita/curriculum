# The map Function


---

## Content


The `map` built-in applies a given function to all elements of a given iterable. 

This allows us to avoid imperative programming, often resulting in more easily legible code. 

In the functional programming style[1], we can achieve the previous code with:

```python
def addTwo(x):
  return x + 2
scores = [1, 0, 4, 5]
print(list(map(addTwo, scores)))
# Result: [3,2,6,7]
```


> ðŸ¥³ Today is 5 of your users' birthdays! Will you use a `for` loop or the `map` function to increment their ages?

## Footnotes


[1:Functional Programming]
As explained in the above footnote, functional programming is a type of declarative style, which focus on **what** is to be computed. 

Functional programming reduces a program down into functions applied to immutable data (data that cannot be directly modified).
