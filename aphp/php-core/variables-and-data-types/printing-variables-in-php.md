# Printing

---

## Content

In PHP, you can use the `echo` language construct to output messages:
```php
echo "Hello, world!";
```

If you want to print a message and move to a new line, you can use the newline character `\n`. 

**Note** that the newline character only works in double-quoted strings:

```php
echo "Hello, world!\n";
```

---
## Practice

Print a message to the console without adding a newline character after the message:
```php
??? "Hello, world!"
```

- `echo`
- `output`

## Practice
