# Let's Create Our First Program!

## Content

Ready for some code?

Remember, we'll write out code in the `Program.cs` file.

In **C#**, you can print text to the screen using the `Console.WriteLine` method:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
// Hello, World!
```

Compiling and Executing our code is as simple as pressing the Run button VSCode!

If all is working, you should see `"Hello World"` printed to the console!
