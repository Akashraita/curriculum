# Creating C# Projects

---

## Content


We can now use Visual Studio to create tons of different types of C# projects.

For now, just create a **Console App** called HelloWorld.

We can use this Console App as a simple sandbox to learn C# syntax.

Once your project is created, our project directory should now contain:
- `Program.cs`: We use `.cs` files to write C# code. When we run our app in the IDE, this file will be compiled and executed.
- `HelloWorld.csproj`: This file tells Visual Studio how to build and execute our application. Luckily, we won't need to edit this file for our simple application.
- Dependencies Folder: Almost all C# projects will have depend on other tools and frameworks. For example, you should see `.Net` as one of the dependencies
