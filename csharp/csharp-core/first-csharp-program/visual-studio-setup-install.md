# The Visual Studio IDE


---

## Content

Visual Studio is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. 

You can download it from [Microsoft's Visual Studio Website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

When the installer prompts you, make sure to also install `.NET Core`.

Remember, **C#** without **.NET** is like a Chef who doesn't know any recipesüë®‚Äçüç≥!
