# Let's Create Our First Program!

---

## Content

Ready for some code?

Remember, we'll write out code in the `Program.cs` file.

In **C#**, you can print text to the screen using the `Console.WriteLine` method:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
// Hello, World!
```

To compile and run our code from the command line, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the directory containing your Program.cs using the command prompt or terminal.
- Compile the code using the C# compiler (csc): csc Program.cs
- Execute the generated executable: ./Program.exe on Windows or mono Program.exe on Linux/Mac.

If everything goes smoothly, you should see the message "Hello World" displayed in your command line or terminal!
