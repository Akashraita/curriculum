# Let's Create Our First Program!

## Content

Ready for some code?

It's time to create our first program!

`"Hello, World!"` is a simple program that prints the text `"Hello, World!"` to the screen. It is often used as a starting point when learning a new programming language.

In **C#**, you can print text to the screen using the `Console.WriteLine` method. Here is an example:
```cpp
using System;

class Program
{
  static void Main()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
  }
}
// Hello, World!
```

To run the program, you can write the code into the **C-Sharp** console, or you can save it to a script file with the `.cs` extension, for instance `hello.cs` and run it using this command in your command line:
```csharp
csc hello.cs
```

You should see the text "Hello, World!" printed to the screen.
