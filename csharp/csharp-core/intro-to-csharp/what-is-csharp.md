# What is C-Sharp?

---

## Content

**C#** (C-Sharp) is a object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. 

It's a versatile language used for Desktop, Mobile, Web, and even Game Development.

Here's an example of C# code where we find out how many pizzas two superheroes ate combined:
```csharp
int spiderman = 3;
int batman = 5;
Console.WriteLine("Together, they ate " + (spiderman + batman) + " pizzas!");
```

> Do not worry if you don't understand the code, we will dive deeper into it later on.
