# What is C-Sharp?

---

## Content

**C#** (C-Sharp) is a object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. 

One of the standout features of **C#** is its strong emphasis on type-safety, garbage collection, and interoperability.

Here's an example of C# code where we find out how many pizzas two superheroes ate combined:
```csharp
int spiderman = 3;
int batman = 5;
Console.WriteLine("Together, they ate " + (spiderman + batman) + " pizzas!");
```

> Do not worry if you do not understand the code, this is just an example to get you confortable with the syntax. We will dive deeper into it later on.
