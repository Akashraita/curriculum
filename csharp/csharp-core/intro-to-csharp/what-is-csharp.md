# What is C-Sharp?

---

## Content

**C#** (C-Sharp) is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It's fully integrated with the **.NET** library, which provides a large range of libraries and frameworks for varied tasks.

One of the standout features of **C#** is its strong emphasis on type-safety, garbage collection, and interoperability with other languages on the **.NET** platform.

Here's an example of **C#** properties, which serve as a way of encapsulating instance variables:
```csharp
public class Rectangle
{
  private double length;
  private double width;

  public double Length
  {
    get { return length; }
    set { length = value; }
  }

  public double Width
  {
    get { return width; }
    set { width = value; }
  }
}
```
