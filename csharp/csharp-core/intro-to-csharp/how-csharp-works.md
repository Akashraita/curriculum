# How does C# work?

---

## Content


When you write C# code, it doesn't run directly; instead, it undergoes a transformative process using a compiler.

The compiler:

1.  Reads your C# code
2. Translates C# into Common Intermediate Language (CIL)
3. When executed, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler[1] turns CIL into machine code.

VoilÃ ! Your program is ready to groove! ðŸŽŠ

Next, will dive into some of the most popular tools in the **C#** ecosystem.

## Footnotes

[1: Just-In-Time Compiler]

The "Just-In-Time" name indicates the timing of the compilation. 
 
Instead of compiling the entire application's CIL code to machine code at once, the JIT compiler does this "just in time" for execution, converting individual methods or functions as they are called. 
 
This approach has both advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that the JIT compiler can optimize the machine code for the specific hardware it's running on. However, there's also an initial performance cost due to the time it takes for JIT compilation.
