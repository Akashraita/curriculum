# Installing C-Sharp Locally


---

## Content

You can install the **.NET** SDK and a **C#** compiler locally on your computer to use it for development.

To install the SDK (which includes the **C#** compiler), you can follow these steps:

- Download the **.NET** SDK from the [official Microsoft website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
- Run the installation file and follow the prompts to install the **.NET** SDK.
- Once the installation is complete, you can start using **C#** by writing **C#** scripts and compiling them with the dotnet command-line tool.
