# `if...else` 

---

## Content

The if statement can be extended to include an `else` clause, which will be executed if the condition is not met.

```csharp
int num = 1;
if (num >= 1) {
  Console.WriteLine("Positive");
} else {
  Console.WriteLine("Zero or Negative");
}
```

The code above will print 'Positive'.
