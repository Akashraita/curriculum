# do...while Loops

---

## Content

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but the difference is that the `do-while` loop will execute the block of code at least once, and then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

Here's an example:
```csharp
int i = 0;

do
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
while(i < 5);
```


---
## Practice

Fill in the blanks to output the numbers 1 through 7:

```csharp
int i = 1;

???
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
???(i ??? 7);

```

- do
- while
- `<=`
- `<`

---
## Revision

Fill in the blanks to output the numbers 5 through 10:

```csharp
int i = 5;

???
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
???(i ??? 10);

```

- do
- while
- `<=`
- `<`
