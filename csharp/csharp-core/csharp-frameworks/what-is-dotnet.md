# What is .NET?

---

## Content

If you find yourself using **C#**, you'll probably also be using the **.NET** framework.

Imagine .NET as a toolbox filled with various tools for building software. 

C# is the skilled craftsman, adept at using these tools. 

When C# needs to create a button for a desktop application, it picks the appropriate tool from the .NET toolbox. 

C# determines the button's behavior, while .NET provides the look and basic functionality. Together, they construct seamless software solutions! 🛠️💻🎉
