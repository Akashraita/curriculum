# Basic Data Types

---

## Content

In **C#**, each variable that we define has an associated data type. 

This is crucial because the data type determines the kind of values that the variable can hold, as well as the operations that can be performed on it.

Here are some basic data types in **C#**:

- `int` for storing integers, like 5, -10, or 99999.
- `double` for storing floating point numbers, like 3.14159 or -0.005.
- `char` for storing single characters, like 'a', 'F', or '2'.
- `bool` for storing Boolean values, i.e., true or false.
- `string` for storing sequences of characters, like "Hello, world!" or "Enki".
