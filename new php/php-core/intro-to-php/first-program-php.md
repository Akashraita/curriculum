# Let's Create Our First Program!

## Content

Ready for some code?

It's time to create our first program! Let's create a `"Hello, World!"` one.

`"Hello, World!"` is a simple program that prints the text `"Hello, World!"` to the screen. It is often used as a starting point when learning a new programming language.

In **PHP**, you can print text to the screen using the `echo` method. Here is an example:
```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>

// Hello, World!
```

To run the program, you can save it to a script file with the `.cpp` extension, for instance `hello.cpp` and run it using this command:
```php
php hello.php
```

You should see the text "Hello, World!" printed to the screen.
