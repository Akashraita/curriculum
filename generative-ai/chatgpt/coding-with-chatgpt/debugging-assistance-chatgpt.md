With ChatGPT, you have a powerful ally while debugging.

You can use it to detect errors, troubleshoot techniques, save time, and more.

To debug, we need to paste a code snippet and, depending on what we want, ask something along these lines:

```plain-text
1) Identify any errors in the following Python code and suggest possible fixes.

# Paste code snippet here

2) How can I debug this specific issue in JavaScript?
