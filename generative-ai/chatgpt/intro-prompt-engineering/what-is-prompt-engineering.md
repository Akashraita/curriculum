# What is Prompt Engineering

---

## Content

---

Prompt engineering represents a novel approach in the field of natural language processing aimed at optimizing the performance of language models.

The essence of prompt engineering lies in the strategic crafting of instructions fed to the model. These prompts are designed to steer the model's responses towards accomplishing a specific task or objective.

By fine-tuning the language and structure of the prompts, one can guide the model to generate more accurate and pertinent responses.
