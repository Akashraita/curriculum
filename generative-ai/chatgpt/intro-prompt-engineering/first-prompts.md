# Let's Write Some Prompts

---

## Content

---

The first thing to keep in mind, the more precise we are with our prompts, the more precise the output will be.

This means, the more context we provide it, the easier it is for the AI to know what we mean and produce a more accurate result.

For instance, here's an example of a vague prompt:

![vague-prompt](https://img.enkipro.com/ac3eaca0e38b46731d659f472f4c4d98.png)

"How do I fix my computer?" can mean many things. Since we didn't specify what we mean, the ai assumed we meant, the ai gave some general steps on how to fix a problem.

Here's another example where we give it more context:

![more-context-prompt](https://img.enkipro.com/50c52a27c0791a187c9c70d5a65562c0.png)

The difference between these two is, one is a vague prompt that can mean more than 1 thing, so the ai has to assume in order to give an answer. Whereas in the other one, we clearly state what issue we need to fix, so it gives a more accurate response.

To summarize, the quality of the output is largely dependent on the quality of the input.
