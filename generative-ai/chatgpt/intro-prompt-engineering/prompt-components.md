# Prompt Components

---

## Content

---

Not every prompt requires all three components; context, instructions, and output. 

In some cases, only one or two may be necessary, depending on the task at hand.

For instance, take a look at this example:

![simple-prompt](https://img.enkipro.com/b29225310c33587cce17ac6764ee4a39.png)

In the above example, there is no context, nor output data, only the input.

The context is assumed based on the "joke" input.

It could be in a casual conversation, a social setting, or even as a way to break the ice in a business meeting.

Here's another where we only give input data:

![square-root-of-a-number](https://img.enkipro.com/f4a7beb6b202a14bd278521268a09b3a.png)

The outputs have no formatting, so it is assumed it should be humorous with the intention of making someone laugh in the first one, and the result of the calculation in the second one.

However, when creating complex prompts, in order to get an accurate response, your prompt should contain context.

Take a look at these with and without context examples:
