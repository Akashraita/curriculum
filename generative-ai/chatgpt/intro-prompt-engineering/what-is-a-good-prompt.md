# What is a Good Prompt?

---

## Content

---

A good prompt consists of several key components; context, instructions, output.

**Context** is the information used to steer the ai in a specific direction

**Instruction/input data** is what you want the ai to do. For instance, answer a question, evaluate an equation, give a joke, write an essay, determine differences between x and y, and so on.

**Output** is how it gives us the output. Can be in a tabular format, code blocks, lists, comma-separated values, and more.

Take a look at this prompt:
```plain-text
"Can you provide me with a list of popular vegetarian restaurants in New York City?"
```

Let's break it down.

The context is the location "New York City".

The input is the list of vegetarian restaurants.

The output would be the `list` keyword which tells the ai to formulate the output as a list.

Additionally, a good prompt is never only a few words. The more data we provide, the easier it will be for the ai to produce an accurate response.
