# What is a Good Prompt?

---

## Content

---

A good prompt consists of several key components; context, instructions, output.

**Context** is the information used to steer the ai in a specific direction

**Instruction/input data** is what you want the ai to do. For instance, answer a question, evaluate an equation, give a joke, write an essay, determine differences between x and y, and so on.

**Output** is how it gives us the output. Can be in a tabular format, code blocks, lists, comma-separated values, and more.

Additionally, a good prompt is never only a few words. The more data we provide, the easier it will be for the ai to produce an accurate response.

It's important to note that not every prompt will require all of these components, and in some cases, only one or two may be necessary depending on the task at hand.

Let's start writing prompts in the next insight!
