# Explain Like Im 5

## Content

The **Explain like im 5** is a very useful prompt. It tells the AI to reply to your prompts through simple explanations even if the question requires a complicated and long explanation.

Here's an example without this prompt:

Now explain like im 5:

![explain-like-im-5-distributed-system](https://img.enkipro.com/c975edf7006af5179d6672c73a016aac.png)

In this case, the **Explain like im 5** used Legos to explain what distributed systems are. 

However, what if we are not satisfied that it used Lego's in the explanation? We can tell it explain again without using that concept:

We can continuously modify how it responds to us until we are satisfied with the response.
