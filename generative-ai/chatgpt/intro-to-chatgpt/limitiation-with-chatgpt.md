# ChatGPT Limitationss

---

## Content

---

Keep in mind that **ChatGPT** has limitations, and its responses may vary depending on the prompts you give it.

Sometimes, ChatGPT hallucinates[1] and confidently provides the wrong response. After all, it is a more complex and intelligent auto-complete[2].

Some of those limitations include:

### Lack of Emotional Intelligence

This means the ai may not always be able to recognize or respond appropriately to emotions expressed in text input.

### Needs Human Oversight

Occasionally, it may generate inaccurate, inappropriate or even offensive responses. Therefore, it is important to have human oversight and intervention when using AI language models to ensure that the responses are appropriate and accurate.

Here's an example where the AI hallucinates and provides a wrong answer:

### Contextual Understanding

While ChatGPT can generate responses based on the text input it receives, it may not always fully understand the context or underlying meaning of a question. This can sometimes result in responses that are not relevant or accurate.

### Knowledge Limitations

While ChatGPT was trained on a vast amount of text data, it still has some limitations in terms of the knowledge it can access. It may not have access to the most up-to-date information, especially in rapidly evolving fields.

As you experiment with it, you'll discover new ways to make the most of this powerful AI tool.

## Footnotes

[1: AI Hallucination]

AI hallucinations happen when artificial intelligence systems generate outputs that lack factual basis or are fictional due to their inability to truly understand the input. These responses should be approached with scepticism as they do not provide accurate information.

[2: Fancy Autocomplete]

ChatGPT is a highly advanced language model that, in essence, functions like an intelligent auto-complete. It leverages its extensive training data and powerful transformer architecture to generate context-aware, coherent, and human-like responses, going far beyond the capabilities of traditional auto-complete tools.
