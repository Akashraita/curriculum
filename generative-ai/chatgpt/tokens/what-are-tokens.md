# What Are Tokens?

**ChatGPT** uses tokens to process and generate text.

Tokens are a basic unit of text, essentally words, puncuation marks and other elements that the model can analyze and manipulate.

When ChatGPT receives input text, it first splits the text into individual tokens, which it then feeds into its neural network to generate a response. 

Each token is assigned a numerical representation, or embedding, that captures its meaning and context within the larger sequence of tokens. 

The AI model then uses its training data to predict the probability of each possible next token based on the sequence of tokens it has seen so far.

In summary, tokens are the fundamental building blocks of language processing in ChatGPT and other neural language models, allowing them to understand and generate human-like text.
