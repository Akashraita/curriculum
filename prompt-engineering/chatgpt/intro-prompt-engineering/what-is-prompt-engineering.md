# What is Prompt Engineering

---

## Content

---

**Prompt engineering** is a relatively new technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to improve the performance of language models.

You provide well-designed prompts or inputs that guide the model's response towards a specific task or goal. 

By carefully selecting the wording, phrasing, and sentence structure of prompts, the model can produce more accurate and relevant responses. 

**Prompt engineering** has the potential to enable more focused and targeted conversations, and to improve the model's ability to perform specific NLP tasks such as language translation and sentiment analysis.
