# Programs & Data

---
## Content

Let's introduce the building blocks we'll cover in this course.


### Programs

Just like you start your day with a to-do list, we give computers their own to-do lists, known as programs, filled with very specific tasks to complete.

> 💡 Scroll down to the Learn more section to see a hilarious example of how specific instructions computers need 😆


### Data

Data is the information that our programs work with. In code, we store these in variables.

For instance, we could store someone's `name` and `age` in variables[1]:
```python
name = "Batman"
age = 30
```


### Types

It’s easy to divide 24 by 2 and get 12. However, dividing "Batman" by 2 might land you in jail.

That's why we group our data into distinct **data types**, the three main ones being:

| Type    | Examples    |
| ------- | ----------- |
| String  | "Batman"    |
| Number  | 5,-0.5     |
| Boolean | True, False |

These data types save us from attempting number-related operations on texts and vice versa.

## Footnotes

[1: What language is this?]
Every language has its own slightly different way of creating variables. The examples in this insight are all in python.

## Practice

In the code below, raining is a ???, temperature is a ???, and forecast is a ???.
```python
raining = True
temperature = 42
forecast = "Today it is 42 degrees and raining"
```

- Boolean
- Number
- String

## Revision

Does a computer know how to divide a string by a number?

???

- No
- Yes
