# Functions are programs too!?

---
## Content

### Using functions as mini programs

Functions allow us to break up our program into mini-programs, each for a specific task that we need. 

For instance, suppose we are simulating a human being that is addicted to coffee! For every cup of coffee, he would need to do the following:

1. find a clean cup
2. boil water
3. open the packet
4. mix the coffee with the boiling water.
5. drink (gulp, gulp)

That's so much work! Instead, imagine if we had one function `make_coffee` with all of these instructions. Every time we want coffee, we write `make_coffee` and, voila! - the work is done.

### Using programs as functions

We can even use other people's programs as functions!

Perhaps someone wrote a smart program called `shortest_path` that calculates the quickest path from point A to point B. 

If we wanted, we could use `shortest_path` as a function in our new food delivery application to show the delivery driver's route.
