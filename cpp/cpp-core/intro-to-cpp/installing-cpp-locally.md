# Installing C++ Locally


---

## Content

To install a C++ compiler (GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection), you can follow these steps:

- Windows: Install Mingw-w64 from the official website. You can use it with an IDE like Code::Blocks or a text editor like VS Code.
- Linux: GCC is probably already installed. If not, you can install it via the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you would use the command sudo apt install build-essential.
- macOS: Install Xcode from the App Store. The Xcode Command Line Tools include a GCC compiler.

Once the installation is complete, you can start using C++ by writing C++ scripts and compiling them with your chosen compiler.
