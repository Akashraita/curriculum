# Compiling C++

---

## Content

When you write C++ code, it doesn't run directly; instead, it goes through a special translator called a compiler. 

The compiler reads your C++ code, translates it into machine code that your computer can understand, and creates an executable file! 

VoilÃ ! Your program is ready to party! ðŸŽŠ

> You'll compile your first C++ program at the end of the workout!
