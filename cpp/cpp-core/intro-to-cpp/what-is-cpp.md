# What is C++?

---

## Content

C++ is a highly efficient, flexible, open-source programming language.

C++ includes features that allow more direct control over the system hardware, making it great for everything from creating operating systems to conducting advanced physics research!

Here's an example of C++ code:
```cpp
int* ptr = new int;  // dynamically allocate memory
*ptr = 10;  // assign value to allocated memory
std::cout << *ptr; // print value
delete ptr;  // deallocate memory
```
