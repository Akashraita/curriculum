# Basic Data Types in C++

---

## Content

In **C++**, each variable that we define must have an associated data type.

This is crucial because the data type determines the kind of values that the variable can hold, as well as the operations that can be performed on it.

Here are some basic data types in **C++**:

`int` for integers, like 5, -10, or 4444.
`float` and double for floating point numbers, like 3.14159 or -0.001.
`char` for single characters, like 'a', 'F', or '2'.
`bool` for Boolean values, i.e., true or false.
`string` (included in the <string> library) for sequences of characters, like "Hello, world!" or "Enki".

It's important to note that unlike in some other languages, in **C++**, you must specify the type of a variable when you declare it.
