# Installing PHP Locally


---

## Content

To install **PHP**, you can follow these steps:

### Windows 

Download the VC15 x64 Non Thread Safe version from the official [PHP website](https://windows.php.net/download/). Then, extract the zip file to a directory.

### Linux 

**PHP** can be installed via the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you would use this command:
```bash 
sudo apt install php.
```

### MacOs

On macOS, **PHP** is preinstalled, but you can use Homebrew to install a more recent version.

```bash
brew install php
``` 

Once the installation is complete, you can start using **PHP** by writing scripts and running them with the **PHP** command-line interface or with a web server that supports **PHP** (like Apache or Nginx).
