# Excel File Types 


---

## Content

Before we find out how to import a file, let's see which file types you can import.

These files are commonly created when you save your spreadsheet. They usually start with `.xl` followed by one or two characters. 

The default file type when saving a spreadsheet is `.xlsx`. 

> ðŸ’¡ If you're using a version of Excel that is older than 2007 then the file type would be `.xls`.

If your spreadsheet contains a macro[1], then it would have the `.xlsm` type.

Templates can have two file types, `.xltx` and `.xltm`. The only difference between the two is that `.xltm` can store macros.

> ðŸ’¡ On Excel versions that are older than 2003, the basic template format is `.xlt`.

If you're using **OpenOffice**, then the default file type is `.ods`.

## Footnotes

[1:Macros]

Macros are mini-programs that do not require any code to make. Their goal is to automate repeatable tasks.

To create a macro, go to the Spreadsheet menu, select "Record Macro", and it will start recording your actions. From there, you can create different macros. You can even add a custom shortcut and name to each macro. Also, you can schedule macros to execute at specific times. 

Here are some things you can do with macros:
- apply different colors at the end of every month to your profit table to easily see the changes in profit
- format (bold, italic, highlight, and others) text or cell groups with the press of a key
- create a specific graph from a selected range of cells
- and many others...
