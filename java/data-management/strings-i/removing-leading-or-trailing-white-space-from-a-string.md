# Removing leading or trailing white space from a string


---

## Content

Sometimes strings will contain unnecessary white space at the beginning or end. This is often due to user input. Unnecessary white space can be removed by using `String.trim()`.

For example:

```java
String original = "    Enki    ";
String trimmed = original.trim();
System.out.println(trimmed);
```

The output printed by the example above will be: `Enki`.
