# More on Functions in Studio
---

## Content

**Studio also provides built-in functions** in the form of `methods`: a type of function that uses the *object, self*, as an argument and a *colon* to call the method. Using these methods may save some time as their code is already scripted into Studio itself.

```lua
--here's an example using the Destroy method, which deletes the identified object.

baseplateVariable = game.Workspace.BasePlate
baseplateVariable:Destroy()
--the object (baseplate) is the variable, and the Destroy() method is called using the colon
--the Destroy method deletes the baseplate.
```

These built-in functions can be found in the object browser.
