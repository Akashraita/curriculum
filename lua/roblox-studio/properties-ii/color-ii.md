# Color Continuation 
---

## Content

Why are there two color properties you may ask? Well, BrickColor is used for naming stuff, whereas Colors follows RGB! 

But doesn't BrickColor also do RGB? Yes, but Color has a nifty extension where **you can use a color tool**. This is not only convenient, but it *automatically converts the 255 RGB values into values from 0 to 1*.

To access the color palette, *either type or click on the `new()` parameters*, and you'll see both the current color and a color wheel. Pressing on the wheel opens up a color palette.
