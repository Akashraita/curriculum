# Changing an Object's Property

---

## Content

Properties refer to the *attributes of an object*. They can be changed using scripts or manually, but we'll be first changing properties manually.

If you haven't done so already, insert an object and click on it. You should see the properties interface show up in the bottom right corner. If not, head to the `view tab` and press on the `properties` button on the left.

In the properties interface, you can click on anything you'd like to change. The main focus will be on the **appearance** section.

### Brickcolor

Changes the *color* of the object. Clicking on the color will bring up a variety of color options.

### CastShadow

Determines whether the object will *cast a shadow* if there is a light source nearby.

### Color

Similar to Brickcolor but provides a *wider variety of colors*.

### Material

Changes the *look/texture* of the object. Clicking on the material will bring up a variety of options.

### Reflectance

Changes how *reflective* the object is when a light source is nearby.
