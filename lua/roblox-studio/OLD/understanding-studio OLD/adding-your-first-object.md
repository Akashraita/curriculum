# Adding your First Object

---

## Content

We can't be forgetting about objects, as they make up the physical aspects of Roblox games! To add an object, in the `insert area` within the `home tab`, press on the `triangle underneath "part"`. This opens up a small menu where you can pick the type of object.

For now, press on block and a grey block should be spawned in.

When you see the block, click on `Scale` in the `tools`and you will find it surrounded by red, blue, and green spheres. These represent the **width, height, and length** of the block.

Drag them in their respective direction to *stretch* or *compress* the block. You can also rotate or move the block through the `tools section` in the `home tab`.
