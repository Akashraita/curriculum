# Adding your First Script

---

## Content
Let‚Äôs finally add a script to our game! Hover over the `ServerScriptServer` in the `explorer tab` and click on the *plus sign*. In the dropdown menu, press on `script`. We will be using Lua, as it's Roblox's main language.

In the new script file, you will notice the line:

```lua
-- A simple print statement
print("Hello World")
```

Let‚Äôs run the game and see what happens.

After witnessing your avatar fall out of who knows where, take a look at the output tab at the bottom. If you scroll up, you will find the following line:

> üí¨ In the output, where it says ‚ÄúHello world!‚Äù, what do you think the text at the very right represents? (hint: look at the print() function in the script).

- Hello World!
- Hello world
