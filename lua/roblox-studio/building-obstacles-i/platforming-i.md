# Platforming
---

## Content

One of the most common forms of obstacles in Roblox is just platforming. In fact, it's a common type of obstacles across various games, such as Mario, Hollow Knight, etc.

While each game has their own style, you can create your OWN style! You can keep things grounded and have towering pillars be the platforms! Or, you can reduce the baseplate and elevate it in the sky so that players HAVE to make platform jumps to make progress! It is YOUR choice.

These platforms can be made by simply adding parts, scaling them, and moving them around. However, you should always activate the anchored property, as you probably don't want players to break them OR you want them to hover in the air.
