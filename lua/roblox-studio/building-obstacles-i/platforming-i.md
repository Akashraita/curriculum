# Platforming
---

## Content

One of the most common forms of obstacles in Roblox is just **platforming**. It's a **common type of obstacles** where players must *traverse various platforms to progress*. Examples of other games include Mario, Hollow Knight, etc.

While each game has their own style, you can **create your OWN style!** You can *keep things grounded* and have towering pillars be the platforms! Or, you can reduce the baseplate and *elevate it in the sky* so that players HAVE to make platform jumps to make progress! It is **YOUR choice**.

These platforms can be made by simply **adding parts, scaling them, and moving them** around. But this is Roblox we're talking about, *why not have some properties continuously change*?

> When building, you should always activate the anchored property, as you probably don't want players to break platorms. It's also useful for having platforms hover in the air.
