# Platforming
---

## Content

Now, obstacle courses may primarily be platforming, but you **don't have to limit yourself to just platforming**! Take some time to consider **what would make an obstacle course fun** in Roblox! 

For instance, using the current content from this introductory course, *why not consider secret paths using collision properties*? Invisible paths, temporary paths, maybe even create a walk-through wall?

> Try to spend some time creating obstacles using what you know. If it feels too complicated, take some inspiration from other games!
