# Vector3 Syntax
---

## Content
**Vector3** can be thought of as a **vector[1] in space**, hence the three which represents 3D space. Using this idea, a vector's magnitude/length and direction can be used to **dictate position and size**.

To code it, you must set a variable equal to a **newly declared Vector3**.
```lua
partVariable = Vector3.new()
```

[1: Vectors]

An object that has magnitude and a direction. Often represented as an arrow, as you can tell its direction by its head, and its magnitude by its length.
