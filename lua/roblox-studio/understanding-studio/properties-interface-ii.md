## Content

If you scrolled through the property window, the amount of options may seem daunting. Don't fret! They're not as complicated as they seem.

### Visual Aspects
The **Appearance** and **Transform** aspects deal with the visuals, such as color and location in the game.

### The Data Aspect
**Data** serves a simple purpose of holding information about the part, such as its name and the parent its found under.

### The Physical Aspect
**Collision** and **Part** focus on the physics of an object, such as whether it holds mass or if it's locked in place.

> **Pivot** is an *extension of Transform*, and **Assembly** is something you shouldn't worry about for this course.
