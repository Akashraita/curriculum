## Content

The most important and basic services are listed below:

### Workspace

Contains any elements that can be interacted with physically in the game.

### ServerScriptService

A *private* storage for your scripts[1], accessed through Studio only.

### ServerStorage 

A *private* storage for your objects, accessed through Studio only.

### ReplicatedStorage

A *public* storage for your objects, accessed by both Studio and the client.

> Why do you think thereâ€™s a separate storage for objects? Why is the ScriptService private to begin with?
