# Changing an Object's Property

---

## Content

Properties refer to the *attributes of an object*. They can be changed using scripts or manually, but we'll be first changing properties manually.

If you haven't done so already, insert an object and click on it. You should see the properties interface show up in the bottom right corner. If not, head to the `view tab` and press on the `properties` button on the left.
