# External Tools

## Content
While most of the fun is building things yourselves, there's no shame in getting help from others. Head to the **view tab** and open up the **toolbox**. 

![toolbox](https://img.enkipro.com/c22e090279952b4f26b7c28136f31d55.png)

Inside, you will structures, vehicles, light sources, even weapons!

> Some models even come with scripts, so if you like their behaviour, take a look at the code used to program them!

What's probably the most important thing to get from toolbox would be **plugins**! Next to the search bar, *press on models* to *open a list*, then *press on plugins*.

These plugins can **provide extra tools**, such as terrain builders, edge smootheners, and even automatic part mergers!

> While most are payed for, some of the free plugins still work fine.

> I personally like F3X building tools, as its free and lets you model more efficiently with its keybinds. It's recommended to search up plugins before using them.
