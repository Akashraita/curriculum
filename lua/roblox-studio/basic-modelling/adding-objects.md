# Adding Other Objects

## Content

Previously, we added a brick to the game. I'm sure you thought that there must be other shapes, and you'd be right! 

Similarly to before, go to the insert area with the "part" button. However, to choose the type of shape, press on the **triangle underneath part**. This opens up a small menu where you can pick the type of object.

If you'd like to change the shape of a part you already placed, this can be done through properties. At the bottom of the Part's section, the shape property can be changed to your desire.
