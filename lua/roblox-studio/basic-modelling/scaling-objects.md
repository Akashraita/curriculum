# Scaling Objects
---

## Content
Scaling objects is also pretty easy. While selecting the block, click on "scale" next to the move button in the tools section. 

This time, there'll be red, blue, and green spheres instead of arrows, indicating you're using the scale tool. To either stretch or compress an object, click on one of the spheres and drag them in their respective directions.
