# Properties to Consider
---

## Content

Aside from using the move, scale, and rotate options in the tools section, you can also change some properties to achieve your desired shape. 

In the transform properties, you will see **size**, **CFrame**, and **origin**. The first two will be useful in modelling, as they allow for even *greater precision in movement and scaling*. 

For **size**, the *height, width, and length can be changed* by changing the X, Y, and Z values. 

> If you're confused on what dimension you're changing, refer to the cube in the top right.

For **CFrame**, you can *change the position* by changing its coordinates, as well as its *degree of rotation* in the X, Y, and Z directions.
