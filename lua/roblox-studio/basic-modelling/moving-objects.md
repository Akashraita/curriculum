# Moving Objects
---

## Content
Moving objects in Studio is fairly simple. You can simply click the object and drag it across the baseplate. 

But what if you want to move your block vertically? Or if you need pinpoint precision? That's where the move tool comes in. While the block is selected, press on move in the tools section.

You will notice that the block is now covered in red, blue, and green arrows. By clicking on them and dragging them in the direction they're pointing, it allows for crisp and accurate movement.
