# Rotating Objects
---

## Content
Rotation is only slightly tricky, but seeing a visual will make it easier to comprehend. While selecting the block, press on "rotate" in the tools section.

You'll see red, blue, and green circles surrounding the block. These are axis of rotation, and by click and dragging one of the circles in their respective direction, the block will turn in that direction.

> To get a better understanding, it's highly recommended to try it out in Roblox Studio yourself!
