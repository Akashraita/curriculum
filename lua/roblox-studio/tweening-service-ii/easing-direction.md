# Easing Styles
---

## Content

As for **EasingDirection**, it refers to *the direction the easing style will play in*. 

"**In**" will play the style *forwards*, "**Out**" will play the style in *reverse*, and "**InOut**" will play the style *forwards for the first half*, then *reverse for the latter half*.

The Syntax for this direction is: `Enum.EasingDirection.Direction`, where you will replace "Direction" with one of the three directions mentioned previously.
