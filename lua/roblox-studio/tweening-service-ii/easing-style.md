## Content

### Easing Style
Easing style is **how movement is animated**. It can have *linear* movement, *exponential* movement, or even have a *bouncy* style of movement.

> All types of movements can be found in the Learn More section. 

The syntax for this style is: `Enum.EasingStyle.TypeOfMovement`, where you will replace the TypeofMovement with the movement style.
