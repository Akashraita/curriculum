# Info Property: Reverses and delayTime
---
## Content

**Reverses** is a **boolean variable** that determines *whether the animation plays in reverse* when it initially completes the first one. 

For instance, let's say an animation starts with an object on the ground, then moves the object up. At the end of the animation,  if Reverses is `true`, the object will return to the ground.

### delayTime
**delayTime** is a variable that will *delay a tween animation by however many seconds* it is given in TweenInfo. 

For instance, if delayTime holds a value of 5, the tween animation won't play until 5 seconds have passed.

## Practice
The ??? variable is responsible for whether the tween animation plays in reverse when the animation completes.

- Reverses
- delayTime
- Time
- repeatCount

## Revision
The ??? variable is responsible for whether there is a delay before the tween animation.

- delayTime
- Reverses
- Time
