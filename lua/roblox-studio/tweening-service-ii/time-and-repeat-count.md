# Info Property: Time and repeatCount
---

## Content

### Time
The **time** variable refers to the *length of the animation in seconds*. If you want a quicker animation, keep the seconds small. If you'd like the animation to be longer, increase the time. 

> Other properties may do better with quicker or faster animations, such as color changes and the degreee of which it changes

### repeatCount

The **repeatCount** variable refers to the *number of times the animation should play*. If you'd like the animation to **play infinitely**, set the value to be **-1**.
