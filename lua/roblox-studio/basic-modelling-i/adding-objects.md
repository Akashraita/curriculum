# Adding Other Objects

## Content

Previously, we added a brick to the game. I'm sure you thought that there must be other shapes, and you'd be right! 

Go to the `insert area` on the home tab with the `Part` button. To choose the type of shape, press on the **triangle underneath `Part`**. This opens up a small menu where you can pick the type of object.

If you'd like to change the shape of a part you already placed, this can be done through the `Property Interface`. At the bottom of the `Part's section`, the shape property can be changed to your desire.
