# Rotating Objects
---

## Content
Rotation is only slightly tricky, but seeing a visual will make it easier to understand. While selecting the block, press on **`rotate` in the tools** section.

You'll see **red, blue, and green circles** surrounding the block. These are **axis of rotation**, and by clicking and dragging one of the circles in their respective direction, the block will turn in that direction.

> To get a better understanding, it's highly recommended to try it out in Roblox Studio yourself!
