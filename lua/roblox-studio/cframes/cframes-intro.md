# CFrames and Vector3
---

## Content
We learned previously that Vector3 can be used as a tool to *change* the **position**, **orientation**, or **size** of an object using vectors in 3D space.

On the other hand, **CFrames**, known as coordinate frames, acts as a data type that holds the positional **and** orientation data of an object. 

> In the future, CFrames will be explored in depth, as there's a multitude of ways to use these. For now, we'll focus on the basics.
