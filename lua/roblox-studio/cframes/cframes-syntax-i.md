# CFrames Syntax
---

## Content
If you recall, CFrames are also known as coordinate frames, as they use coordinates to change the value of positions and orientations. To differentiate positions and orientations, there are two different syntax.

### Position
If you're changing a position using CFrames, you would call a new CFrame, followed by X, Y, and Z values.

```lua
partVariable.CFrame = CFrame.new(x, y, z)
```
