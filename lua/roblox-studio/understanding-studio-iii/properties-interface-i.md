# The Property Interface

---

## Content

`Properties` refer to the **attributes of an object**. They can be changed using scripts or manually.

> For now, we'll focus on manual changes.

To prompt the property window, *add a part* using the `insert tool`.

*When the block is selected* (the edges should be highlighted in blue), you should now see that the properties window has deemed you worthy and has now shared its knowledge.
