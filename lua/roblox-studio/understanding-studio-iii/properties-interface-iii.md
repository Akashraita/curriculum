## Content

Here are the remaining properties.


### The Physical Aspect
**Collision** and **Part** focus on the physics of an object, such as whether it holds mass, if it's locked in place, or if it can physically collide with other parts.


> **Pivot** is an *extension of Transform*, and **Assembly** is something you shouldn't worry about for this course. 

If you're curious about their functions, you can play around with each property using an inputted block. If you'd like to know more about a specific property, hover over the name and they'll provide a quick summary if available.
