# Applying Multiple Scripts

One thing you might have noticed is that when we create scripts, we would have to create multiple copies of the script to apply to multiple objects. This is not very organized, nor is it efficient when you want to create multiple kill blocks, or if you want to create multiple platforms that move in the same way.

One way to avoid this issue is to group all related parts into a model and loop through each child/part in the model.

To create a model, right-click on a part and select Group as Model. A new model should be created with the parts inside it. New parts can be dragged into the model, as if you're moving files into a folder.
