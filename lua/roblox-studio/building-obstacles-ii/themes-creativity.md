# Themes and Creativity

## Content

As of 2023, Roblox has evolved from a simple funny lego game. People have gotten better at coding, and games are even more polished. Even if you have the basics down, its the ideas and presentation that attracts attention. 

In the case of obbys, try to create a theme or some sort of gimmick. Why not consider a platformer with different worlds and various secrets? Or perhaps turn these obbys into a race where a player gets to control the obstacles? Maybe even develop an automated process of creating obbys from scratch?

These are all real Roblox games that have, at one point, been very popular, or still are to this day. 

Now, don't stress yourselves too quickly, you've just finished taking the hard steps to open up this path to begin with! Just keep practicing, and even try out other Roblox games to grab some ideas from. I believe that anyone can reach those standards with enough time and effort.
