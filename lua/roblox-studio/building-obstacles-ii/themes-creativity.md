As of 2023, Roblox has evolved from a simple funny Lego game. People have gotten better at coding and building as games become more polished every year. Even if you have the basics down, it's the ideas and presentation that attract attention. 

In the case of obbys, try to consider a theme or some sort of gimmick. How about a platformer with different worlds and various secrets? Or perhaps turn these obbys into a race where a player gets to control the obstacles? Maybe even develop an automated process of creating obbys from scratch?
