# Intro to TweenService
---

## Content
For the last few workouts, there was an emphasis on properties. You may have started thinking on how scripting can change properties while the game is running such as using loops! However, you may have also realized that using **loops can make changes very choppy**.

Thus, most developers tend to use **TweenService** instead of making loops. It is an animation tool that can be explained as **going from point A to point B**. However, what's interesting is that these *points do not necessarily have to be positions*. 

For instance, we can go from a transparency of 1 to 0.5, change an orientation little by little to a specific point, or even change colors!

As long as there is a point A and a point B, tweening is a tool that is much **more efficient, flexible and smoother** than making loops.
