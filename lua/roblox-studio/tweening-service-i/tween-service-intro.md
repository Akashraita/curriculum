# Intro to TweenService
---

## Content
So far, we went over how we could use loops to make continuous changes to properties. These exercises were to get you used to the ideas of properties, their syntax, and how they interact with the rest of the game's code. 

However, most developers tend to use **TweenService** instead of making loops. It is an animation tool that can be explained as **going from point A to point B**. However, what's interesting is that these *points do not necessarily have to be positions*. 

For instance, we can go from a transparency of 1 to 0.5, change an orientation little by little to a specific point, or even change colors!

As long as there is a point A and a point B, tweening is a tool that is much **more efficient, flexible and smoother** than making loops.
