# Intro to TweenService
---

## Content

Most developers tend to use `TweenService`. It is **an animation tool** that can be explained as **going from point A to point B**. However, what's interesting is that these *points do not necessarily have to be positions*. 

For instance, we can have an orientation change consistently over a period of time!

As long as there is a point A and a point B, tweening is a tool that is much **more efficient, flexible and smoother** than making loops.
