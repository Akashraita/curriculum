# Scripting Properties

## Content

To change a property, we must **first access the part**. One way of accessing it can be done through `variables`[1]. 

To indicate that we want to access a property, we can simply **add a period after the variable, followed by the property**.

```lua
partVariable = game.Workspace.Part

-- To access the BrickColor property.
partVariable.Brickcolor
```

> We'll be going through a few of the important properties for the next few workouts. Note that the method of changing each property requires different syntaxes.

## Practice

To access the "Transparency" property of the "blockVariable" variable, the following code grants us this access:

```lua
???.???
```

- blockVariable
- Transparency
- partVariable
- newTransparency
