# The ToolBox

---

## Content

While most of the fun is building things yourself, there's no shame in getting help from others. Head to the **view tab** and open up the `toolbox`. 

![toolbox](https://img.enkipro.com/c22e090279952b4f26b7c28136f31d55.png)

Inside, you will find structures, vehicles, light sources, and even weapons!

> Some models even come with scripts, so if you like their behaviour, take a look at the code used to program them!
