# Plugins

## Content
What's probably the most important thing to get from toolbox would be **plugins**! Next to the search bar, *press on models* to *open a list*, then *press on plugins*.

These plugins can **provide extra tools**, such as terrain builders, edge smootheners, and even automatic part mergers!

> While most are payed for, some of the free plugins still work fine.

I personally like *F3X building tools*, as its **free** and lets you **model efficiently** with keybinds. 

> It's recommended to search up plugins before using them.
