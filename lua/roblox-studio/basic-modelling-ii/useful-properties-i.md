# Properties to Consider

---

## Content

Aside from using the move, scale, and rotate options in the tools section, you can also change some properties to achieve your desired shape. 

In particular, you can consider using transform properties, such as **size** and **CFrame**. They are useful as they allow for even *greater precision in movement and scaling*.
