# The Print Output

## Content

After witnessing your avatar fall out of who knows where, take a look at the output tab at the bottom. If you scroll up, you will find the following line:

![first-print-line](https://img.enkipro.com/5359fcdecec00d1433765c0f65e813a4.png)

One thing to note is that at the very right of "Hello World!", you will see the line "Script:1". This is the system telling you the name of the script from where the print statement ran, as well as the line number.

## Practice

Let's say you make a new game and put in a script in the ServerScriptServer. If you were to name the script: "FLYING" and change nothing else, you would see ???:??? at the very right of the output when you run the script.

- FLYING
- 1
- Script
- script
- 3
- 4
