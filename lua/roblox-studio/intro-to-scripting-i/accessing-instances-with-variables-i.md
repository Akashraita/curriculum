# Declaring Variables
---

> The available options that can change these types of variables will be focused in the properties workouts.

To reference an element, we must *first declare a variable*. Let's create a variable that will hold the baseplate of the game.

```lua
baseplateVariable = 
--Declare variable 
```

## Practice
```lua
coolVariable = x
coolerVariable = x + 1
whichOneIsCooler(x)
```
From the code above, the variables that were defined are ???

- coolVariable and coolerVariable
- coolVariable
- coolerVariable
- whichOneIsCooler(x)
