# Adding a Script

## Content
Let’s finally add a script to our game! Hover over the **ServerScriptService** in the **explorer tab** and click on the *plus sign*. In the dropdown menu, press on **script**. We will be using Lua, as it's Roblox's main language.

In the new script file, you will notice the line:

```lua
print("Hello World")
```
Let’s run the game and see what happens.
