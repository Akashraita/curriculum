In the lua course, you would've learned about events being **signals** that are transmitted **whenever a specific action or change happens**. In such an interactive game such as Roblox, it makes sense that Roblox games are primarily made up of events! 

Not only are you able to *connect functions to a specific event*, but events can also be used in communications between the server and scripts, or multiple scripts, respectively known as **remote events** and **bindable events**.
