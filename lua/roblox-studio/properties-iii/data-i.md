# Data Property: Name

---

## Content

The data properties tend to act more as information you can use to identify the part, but there are still some properties that can be changed.

---

### Name
The **name** property holds the part's name. The name can be changed by setting the variable equal to the **new desired name in quotation marks**.

```lua
partVariable.Name = "Edited Part"
--As soon as this line runs, the part's name is now Edited Part.
--Useful if you need to identify changed parts while running a script.
```

## Practice
Let's say I made a script that changes incomplete instances into complete ones, and I want to differentiate the incomplete ones from the complete ones by editing their names. 

Finish the code that lets me change the name of a newly completed instance to "Updated3.3" in Baseplate.

```lua
completedPartVariable = game.Workspace.Baseplate.Incomplete
completedPartVariable.??? = ???
```
- Name
- "Updated3.3"
- Locked
- Parent
- Updated3.3
