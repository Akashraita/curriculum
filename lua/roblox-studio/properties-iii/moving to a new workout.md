# CFrames and Vector3
---

## Content
Before moving on to the last 2 properties, I'd like to touch upon **CFrames** and **Vector3** so you don't get confused when one is used over the other. 

**Vector3** is the data that deals with the **3D space and dimensions** of an object. For now, see it as a tool to *change* the **position** of an object.

On the other hand, **CFrames**, known as coordinate frames, acts as a data type that holds the **positional and orientation** data of an object. 

> In the future, these topics will be more in depth, as there's a multitude of ways to use these two data types.
