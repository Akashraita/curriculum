## Revision

Which of these actions do not match the purpose? ???

Action1: Creating involves creating the name of the function
Action2: Defining involves creating the function to be called
Action3: Triggering involves calling the function.

- Action1. Creating involves creating an event, not the name.
- Action2. Defining involves creating the event, not the name
- Action3. Triggering doesn't call the function, it's a safety net for when it doesn't call.
- All actions match their purpose
