# What are Events?

---
## Content

In Lua, an event is a signal that something has occurred, such as a button being clicked or a key being pressed. 

Events are used extensively to create interactive programs. They are typically handled using event handlers, which are functions that are called when an event occurs. 

These functions are registered with the event system, and Lua calls them automatically when the corresponding event occurs.

Event-driven programming is a popular paradigm for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and other interactive applications.

In this approach, the program waits for user input or other events and then responds by executing the appropriate code. 

This allows the program to be more efficient, as it only executes code when it is needed, rather than continuously polling for changes.
