## Content

Now hold your horses! Before you can start coding in Lua, **you need a way to code and test Lua language**.

For this course, coding on **an online IDE[1] is perfectly fine**! You can view online demo programs here: [live demo](https://www.lua.org/demo.html).

While it's recommended to code on a computer, you can also code Lua on Android using **LuaDroid**.

> Note that if you are planning to code on Roblox, *Lua comes installed with Roblox Studio*!
