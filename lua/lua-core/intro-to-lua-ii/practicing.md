# Practicing Coding

---
## Content

Once you have Lua installed and a text editor set up, it's time to start learning the basics of the language.

**Practice with examples**: As you learn, try writing some small Lua programs on your own. You can find plenty of example code throughout this course as well as online.

Remember, the key to getting started with Lua (or any language) is to start small and be patient with yourself. With practice, you'll soon be writing Lua code like a pro!
