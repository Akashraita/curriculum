# Arithmetic Operators

---
## Content

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers.

The common arithmetic operators in Lua include:

|      Name      | Sign |
|:--------------:|:----:|
|    Addition    |  (+) |
|   Subtraction  |  (-) |
| Multiplication |  (*) |
|    Division    |  (/) |
|     Modulo     |  (%) |
| Exponentiation |  (^) |

Here are some examples of arithmetic operators in Lua:
```lua
-- Addition
result = 2 + 3  -- result = 5

-- Subtraction
result = 10 - 5  -- result = 5

-- Multiplication
result = 4 * 6  -- result = 24

-- Division
result = 10 / 2  -- result = 5

-- Modulo
result = 10 % 3  -- result = 1

-- Exponentiation
result = 2^3  -- result = 8
```

It's important to note that arithmetic operators in Lua follow the standard order of operations[1]. To change the order of operations, you can use parentheses.

## Footnotes

[1:Standard Order of Operations]

The standard order of operations is refered to as **PEMDAS** or **BODMAS**.

**PEMDAS** stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction

**BOMDAS** stands for brackets, orders, division and multiplication, and addition and subtraction
