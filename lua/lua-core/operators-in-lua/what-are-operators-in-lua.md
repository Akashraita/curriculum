# What are Operators?

---
## Content

In Lua, operators are used to perform arithmetic, logical, and relational operations on values. 

The arithmetic operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. 

The logical operators include and, or, and not.

The relational operators include less than, greater than, equal to, and not equal to. 

Lua also provides bit-wise operators and concatenation operator for strings.

They can be used with various data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, and tables, and can be combined to form more complex expressions. 

Understanding the precedence of operators is important as it determines the order in which operations are executed.

In addition to the built-in operators, Lua also provides a mechanism for defining custom operators using metamethods. This allows for a more flexible and expressive programming style.
