# elseif Statements

---
## Content

You can also use the `if`, `else`, and `elseif` statements to create more complex conditional statements. The `elseif` statement is used when you want to **check for multiple conditions**, but **only execute one block of code**.

The basic syntax for an `if`, `elseif`, `else` statement is as follows:
```lua
if condition then
   -- code to execute if condition is true
elseif condition2 then
   -- code to execute if condition2 is true
else
   -- code to execute if neither conditions are true
end
```
