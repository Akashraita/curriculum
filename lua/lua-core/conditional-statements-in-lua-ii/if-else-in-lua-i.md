# if-else Statements

---
## Content

`if-else` statements are used to execute code blocks based on certain conditions. In Lua, `if-else` statements can be implemented using the `if` and `else` keywords.

The basic syntax for an `if-else` statement is as follows:
```lua
if condition then
   -- code to execute if condition is true
else
   -- code to execute if condition is false
end
```
