# repeat Loops

---
## Content

In Lua, `repeat` loops are another type of loop that **allows code to be repeated until a specific condition is met**. 

The difference between a `repeat` loop and other types of loops is that the **code inside a `repeat` loop is executed at least once** before checking the loop condition. 

This means that the code in a `repeat` loop **will always run at least once**, no matter what the initial condition is.
