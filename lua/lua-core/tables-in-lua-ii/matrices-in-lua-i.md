# Matrices Introduction

---

## Content

A matrix is a **two-dimensional array**, which can be used to *represent tables of data with rows and columns*. It is **essentially an array of arrays**, with **each sub-array representing a row** of the matrix.

Matrices are **commonly used in mathematical computations**, such as linear algebra, where they are used to represent vectors and transform matrices. 

However, they can also be used for **other types of data**, such as *representing a grid of game board* positions in a game of chess or *representing pixel values* in an image.
