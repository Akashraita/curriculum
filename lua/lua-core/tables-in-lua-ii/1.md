# Tables Can Store Functions!

---
## Content

A useful technique when working with tables is to assign functions as values to table keys. This can be used to create methods for the table or to provide a namespace for related functions. When a function is assigned to a table key, it is called a method of the table.

Here's an example of defining a table with a method:
```lua
-- define a table with a method
my_table = {
  value = 0,
  increment = function(self)
    self.value = self.value + 1
  end
}

-- call the method
my_table:increment()
print(my_table.value) -- prints 1
```






```lua
my_object = {
    name = "Charlie",
    age = 20,
    say_hello = function(self)
        print("Hello, my name is " .. self.name .. " and I'm " .. self.age .. " years old.")
    end
}

my_object:say_hello()
```

In this example, we've defined a method `say_hello` on `my_object` that prints a greeting to the console. We can call this method using the `:` operator, which automatically passes the table itself as the first argument.
