# The "And" Operator

---
## Content


The `and` operator returns `true` only **if both of its operands are true**, and `false` otherwise. 

Here are some examples:
```lua
-- and operator
print(true and true)   --> true
print(true and false)  --> false
print(false and false) --> false
```

---
## Practice

In the code below, variable a is ??? and variable c is ??? 

```lua
a = (true and true)
b = (false and false) 
c = (true and false)  
```

- true
- false
- "true"
- "false"
