# Logical Operators

---

## Content

Logical operators are used to **perform logical operations on boolean** values. 

> Recall that boolean values are either always true or false.

These operators **provide specific instructions on how boolean values will be deemed true or false**. For instance, if there are two conditions, one operator can set the boolean to be true if both conditions are met. 

The three logical operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`.
