# repeat Loop Example

---
## Content

Let's look at a `repeat` loop example. In this example, we will repeatedly ask the user for their input until they guess a value we want:

```lua
-- initialize a variable to keep track of the user's guess
guess = ""

-- keep prompting the user for their guess until they get it right
repeat
  -- prompt the user for their guess
  print("Guess a number between 1 and 10:")

  -- read in the user's guess from standard input
  guess = io.read()

  -- check if the guess is correct
  if guess == "7" then
    print("Congratulations, you guessed correctly!")
  else
    print("Sorry, that guess was incorrect. Please try again.")
  end
until guess == "7"
```
