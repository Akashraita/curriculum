# What are Loops?

---
## Content

In programming, a loop is a fundamental construct that allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly. Loops are often used to process a set of data or to perform repetitive tasks. Lua provides several types of loops to accomplish this.

The two main types of loops in Lua are the `while` loop and the `for` loop. The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is true, and the `for` loop executes a block of code a fixed number of times.

In addition to these, Lua also has the `repeat` loop, which is similar to the `while` loop, except that the condition is checked at the end of the loop instead of the beginning. This guarantees that the loop will execute at least once.

Loops are essential for controlling program flow and performing tasks efficiently. By understanding the different types of loops in Lua and when to use them, you can write more effective code and solve problems more efficiently.
