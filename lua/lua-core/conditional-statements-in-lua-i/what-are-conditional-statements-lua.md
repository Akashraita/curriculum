# What are Conditional Statements?

---
## Content

In Lua, like in many other programming languages, you can **use conditional statements to make decisions in your code** based on whether certain conditions are true or false.

The most common types of conditional statements in Lua are the `if` statement, the `if...else` statement, and the `if...elseif...else` statement.

Think of these as **option 1 and option 2**. If a condition is fulfilled, go with option 1. Otherwise, go with option 2. 

> This idea can be expanded to more than 2 options and conditions!
