# Vararg Expression (...)

---
## Content

In Lua, three dots `...` is a **syntactic construct** called a **vararg expression**. 

It represents a **variable number of arguments passed** to a function. When used as a parameter in a function definition, it **allows the function to accept any number of arguments**. 

This is very useful when you ask for a user to list as many things that are related to the question! For instance, consider an online form that asks for the number of job and volunteering experiences that are related to a part-time job.
