# While Loops

---
## Content

A `while` loop allows you to **execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true**. The basic structure of a while loop in Lua looks like this:

```lua
while condition do
  -- code to be executed while condition is true
end
```

The `condition` expression is **evaluated at the beginning of each iteration** of the loop. 

If the expression is true, then the code inside the loop is executed. This process continues until the `condition` expression becomes false.
