# For Loops

---

## Content

A `for` loop in Lua is used to **loop through a range of values**, which can be numbers or elements of a table or an array. The syntax for a `for` loop is:
```lua
for variable = start_value, end_value, increment do
  -- body of the loop
end
```

The `variable` in the loop is initialized to the `start_value` and incremented by the `increment` value for each iteration until it reaches the `end_value`. 

The `increment` value can be positive or negative, and if not specified, it defaults to 1.
