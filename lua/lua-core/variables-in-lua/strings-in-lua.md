# Strings

---
## Content

A **string** is a **sequence of characters**, such as *letters, numbers, and symbols*. 

You can create a string variable in Lua by **enclosing the text in quotation marks.**

Here's an example of creating a couple of different string variables and printing them together:
```lua
str = "My name is Stefan and I'm"
str2 = "30"
str3 = "Hello!" 
print(str3, str, str2, "years old")

--- Hello!	My name is Stefan and I'm	30	years old
```

---
## Practice

Write a Lua program that creates a `name` variable and assigns "Mike" to it, then prints its value.

```lua
??? = ???
???(my_number)
```

- `name`
- `"Mike"`
- `print`
- `Mike`
- `output`


---
## Revision

Create a string variable called `str` and set its value to `"Yes"`.

```lua
??? ??? ???
```

- `str`
- `=`
- `"Yes"`
- `string`
- `yes`
- `-`
