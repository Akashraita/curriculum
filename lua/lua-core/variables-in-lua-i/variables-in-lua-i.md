# What are Variables in Lua?

---

## Content

In Lua, a variable is a **named storage location** in the computer's memory that **holds a value**.

These "values" can come in different forms. They can be a *number*, a *word*, or a *more complex data structure*. 

Why use variables? Well, they **allow you to store and manipulate data dynamically**, making your code more flexible and powerful. 

Additionally, with good naming practice, variables can also help with a code's organization!
