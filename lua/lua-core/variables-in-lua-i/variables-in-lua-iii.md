# Tips When Assigning Variables

---
## Content

When creating a variable, you can name them whatever you like. For instance:

```lua
cool_variable = 20
```

However, for purposes of organization and readability, it's **best to name variables based on their purpose**. For example, let's say we want to assign the value 20 to a wallet, we can write `wallet_cash = 20`.

> The common naming convention for Lua is using **underscores to separate words** in variable names, but any other naming convention such as **camelCase** should be used when other collaborators use them.
