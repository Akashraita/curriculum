# Numbers

---
## Content

Numbers are one of the most commonly used data types in programming, and Lua is no exception. Lua supports both integer and floating-point numbers, and you can perform a wide variety of mathematical operations with them.

Here's an example of creating and printing an integer variable in Lua:
```lua
my_number = 42
print(my_number)
-- 42
```

And one more using floating-point numbers:
```lua
num2 = 42.31
print(num2)
```

**Note** that you can create and assign values to multiple variables on the same line:
```lua
num1, num2 = 1, 2
print(num1, num2)
-- 1 2
```

---
## Practice

Write a Lua program that creates a `my_number` variable and prints its value to the console.

```lua
??? = 42
???(my_number)
```

- `my_number`
- `print`
- `write`
- `myNumber`


---
## Revision

Create a variable called `num` and set it to `31`.

```lua
??? ??? ???
```

- num
- =
- 31
