# Booleans

---
## Content

A boolean is a logical value that can be either true or false. You can create a boolean variable in Lua using the true and false keywords.

Here's an example of creating a boolean variable in Lua:
```lua
bool = true
bool2 = false
```



---
## Practice

Write a Lua program that creates a `my_number` variable and prints its value to the console.

```lua
??? = 42
???(my_number)
```

- my_number
- print
- write
- myNumber


---
## Revision

Create a boolean variable called `my_boolean` and set it to `true`.

```lua
??? = ???
```

- my_boolean
- true
- false
