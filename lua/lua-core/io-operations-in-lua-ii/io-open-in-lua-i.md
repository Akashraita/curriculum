# I/O Open & Close I

---
## Content

The `io.open` function is used for opening a file in various modes. 

It takes **two arguments**: the **file name** and the **mode** used to open the file. The mode can be either `"r"` for reading, `"w"` for writing, or `"a"` for appending to an existing file. 

> If the mode is not specified, `"r"` is used by default.
