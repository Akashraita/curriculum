# For Loops

---

## Content

A `for` loop in Lua is used to **loop through a range of values**, which can be numbers, elements of a table, or an array.

In Lua, the syntax for a `for` loop is as follows:

```lua
for variable = start_value, end_value, increment do
  -- body of the loop
end
```

The `variable` in the loop is initialized to the `start_value` and incremented by the `increment` value for each iteration until it reaches the `end_value`. 

The `increment` value can be positive or negative, and if not specified, it defaults to 1.

## Practice

Finish the code for a `for` loop below with the following conditions:

A start value of 0, an end value of 20, and an increment of 5

```lua
for variable = ???, ???, ??? do
  -- body of the loop
end
```

- `0`
- `20`
- `5`

---

## Revision

In the code below, how many times will the `for` loop repeat? ???
```lua
for variable = 20, 50, 5 do
  -- body of the loop
end
```
