# What are Loops?

---
## Content

In programming, a loop is a fundamental construct that **allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly**. 

Thus, loops are often used to *process a set of data* or to *perform repetitive tasks* **while writing less code**. 

Here's the difference between fully writing out steps compared to using a simple loop:

```lua
-- printing 5 times WITHOUT a loop
print("Hello, World!")
print("Hello, World!")
print("Hello, World!")
print("Hello, World!")
print("Hello, World!")

-- printing 5 times WITH a loop
for i = 1, 5 do
    print("Hello, World!")
end
```
