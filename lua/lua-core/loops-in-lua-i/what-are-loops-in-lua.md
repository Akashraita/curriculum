# What are Loops?

---
## Content

In programming, a loop is a fundamental construct that **allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly**. 

Loops are often used to *process a set of data* or to *perform repetitive tasks*. 

In Lua, there are several types of loops that execute repeatedly with specific conditions. By understanding the different types of loops in Lua and when to use them, you *can write more effective code* and *solve problems more efficiently* **while writing less code**.

Here's an example of pseudocode where numbers are added consecutively:
