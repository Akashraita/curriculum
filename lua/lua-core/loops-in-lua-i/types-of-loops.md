# Types of Loops

---
## Content

The two main types of loops in Lua are the `while` loop and the `for` loop. 

The `while` loop executes a block of code **as long as a condition is true**.

The `for` loop executes a block of code **a fixed number of times**.

In addition to these, Lua also has the `repeat` loop, which is similar to the `while` loop, except that the **condition is checked at the end of the loop** instead of the beginning. 

This guarantees that the **loop will execute at least once**.

## Practice

What is the difference between `while` loops and `repeat` loops?

- The while loop checks the condition at the very beginning
- The repeat loop checks the condition at the very beginning
- There are no differences
- The while loop checks the condition at the end of each loop

---

## Revision

Which of these definitions don't match with their respective loops? ???

While Loop: Checks for a condition at the beginning of every loop that determines if it loops to begin with.
For Loop: Checks for a condition in the middle of every loop that determines if it should continue the current loop.
Repeat Loop: Checks for a condition at the end of every loop that determines if it should loop again.

- For Loop
- Repeat Loop
- While Loop
