# Array

## Content


```lua
my_object = {
    name = "Charlie",
    age = 20,
    say_hello = function(self)
        print("Hello, my name is " .. self.name .. " and I'm " .. self.age .. " years old.")
    end
}

my_object:say_hello()
```

In this example, we've defined a method `say_hello` on `my_object` that prints a greeting to the console. We can call this method using the `:` operator, which automatically passes the table itself as the first argument.
