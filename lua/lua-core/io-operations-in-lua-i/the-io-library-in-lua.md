# The IO Library

---
## Content

The **IO** library in Lua **provides a set of built-in functions** for dealing with **input and output operations**. 

These functions allow you to perform operations like *reading and writing* files, *opening and closing* streams, and working with the file system.

These functions allow you to perform a wide range of input/output operations, making the IO library an important part of many Lua programs.
