# Local Variables

---
## Content

The `local` keyword in Lua is used to declare a variable with a local scope. This means that the variable can **only be accessed and modified within the block of code where it was defined**. 

Using `local` is generally recommended as it can **help prevent naming conflicts** and **makes code easier to read and maintain**.

> Unlike local variables, global variables do not need to be specifically declared to be denoted as a global variable.
