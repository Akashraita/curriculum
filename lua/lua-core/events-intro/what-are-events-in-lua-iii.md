# What are Events? III

---
## Content

**Event-driven programming** is a popular paradigm for **creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs)** and other **interactive applications**.

In this approach, the **program waits for user input or other events** and **then responds by executing the appropriate code**. 

This *allows the program to be more efficient*, as it **only executes code when it is needed**, rather than continuously polling for changes.
