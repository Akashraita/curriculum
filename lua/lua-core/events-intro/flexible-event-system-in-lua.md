# Flexible Event System

---
## Content

In Lua, developers can write **code that listens for specific events**, such as user input or changes to the state of the application, and **responds accordingly**. 

Examples of events in Lua include:
- mouse clicks
- key presses
- network events
- timer events

By using event handlers, **developers can write code that waits for these events to occur** and then **performs a specific action** or set of actions in response. 

This enables the creation of interactive applications with smooth and intuitive user experiences.
