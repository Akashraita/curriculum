# What are Events? II

---
## Content

**Event-driven programming** is a popular paradigm for **creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs)** and other **interactive applications**.

In this approach, the **program waits for user input or other events** and **then responds by executing the appropriate code**. 

This *allows the program to be more efficient*, as it **only executes code when it is needed**, rather than continuously polling for changes.

## Practice

In Event-driven programming, what does the program do? ???

- Waits for user input FIRST before executing the appropriate code
- Executes a line of code FIRST before waiting for user input or other events
- Program completely relies on events and no input
- Program completely relies on input, as events are built-in and don't need to be triggered.

## Revision

Why should you use Event-driven programming? ???

- Increases efficiency, as the program executes code only when needed
- Increases efficiency, as everything can be written as an event
- Increases readability, which helps readers understand better
- Increases readability, as events are highlighted automatically by Lua
