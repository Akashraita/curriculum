# What are Events? I

## Content

In Lua, an **event** is a **signal that something has occurred**, such as a button being clicked or a key being pressed. 

Events are used extensively to **create interactive programs**. They are typically handled using **event handlers**, which are **functions that are called when an event occurs**. 

These functions are *registered with the event system*, and **Lua calls them automatically** when the **corresponding event occurs**.
