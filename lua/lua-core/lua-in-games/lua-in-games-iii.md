Lua is also **used in other games for various purposes**, such as *defining game rules*, *controlling AI behavior*, and *implementing dynamic events*. 

For example, in the game **Garry's Mod**, Lua scripts are used to **create custom game modes**, **modify the game's physics engine**, and **create custom player models and weapons**.
