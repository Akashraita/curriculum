# Lua in WoW

---

## Content

One example of the usefulness of Lua in a game can be seen in the **popular game World of Warcraft (WoW)**. Lua scripts are used extensively in World of Warcraft to **allow players to customize** their user interface, automate tasks, and create add-ons to enhance their gameplay experience.

Not only can developers use Lua to create games, but **players can write such scripts to tailor their game experience** to their preferences, making it more enjoyable and efficient!

## Practice

What purpose is there for players to be able to use Lua for games? ???

- Create small things to customize their own game experience
- Access a game's code and recreate it one by one
- Ruin the experience for other players
- There isn't. Why would players use Lua if they're playing the game?
