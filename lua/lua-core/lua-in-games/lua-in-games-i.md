# Lua in Games

---
## Content

Lua is **often used in the development of video games** as a scripting language to **allow for dynamic behavior** of game objects, game logic, and other game-related events. 

It is often used as an embedded scripting language in game engines such as Unity, Corona SDK, and Love2D.

One such game is **Roblox**, where various aspects are controlled by the creator to create their own games! As such, Lua is **perfect to create user-dependent game behaviour**, as well as all sorts of aspects regarding building and game design.
