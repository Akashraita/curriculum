# Array Intro

---
## Content

In Lua, an `array` is a collection of elements of any data type, indexed by integer values starting at 1. 

An `array` can be created by initializing a `table` with a sequence of values, or by assigning values to specific indices. 

Unlike some other programming languages, Lua does not have a separate data type for arrays; instead, arrays are implemented as a special kind of `table`.
