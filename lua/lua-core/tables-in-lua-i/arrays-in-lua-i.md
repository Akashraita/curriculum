# Array Intro

---
## Content

In Lua, an `array` is a **collection of elements of any data type**, indexed by **integer values starting at 1**. 

> It's important to remember that unlike other coding languages, **Lua does NOT use zero indexing (starting from 0)**.

An `array` can be created by **initializing a `table`** with a *sequence of values*, or by *assigning values to specific indices*. 

Unlike some other programming languages, **Lua does not have a separate data type for arrays**; instead, arrays are implemented as a special kind of `table`.
