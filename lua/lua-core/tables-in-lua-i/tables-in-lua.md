# Tables

---

## Content

A **table** is a data structure that can **hold a collection of values**. Tables in Lua are **very versatile** and can be used to *represent arrays, dictionaries, and other data structures*. You can *create a table* in Lua by **enclosing a list of values in curly braces.**

Here's an example of creating a table in Lua:
```lua
my_table = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```
A *table in the above form*, can also be referred to as an **Array**.
