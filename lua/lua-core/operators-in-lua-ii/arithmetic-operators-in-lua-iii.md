# Modulo and Exponentation

---
## Content

The arithmetic operators for Modulo[1] and Exponentation in Lua are:

|      Name      | Sign |
|:--------------:|:----:|
|     Modulo     |  (%) |
| Exponentiation |  (^) |

Here are some examples of arithmetic operators in Lua:
```lua
-- Modulo
result = 10 % 3  -- result = 1

-- Exponentiation
result = 2^3  -- result = 8
```

> It's important to note that arithmetic operators in Lua follow the standard order of operations[1]. To change the order of operations, you can use parentheses.

```lua
result = 2^3 
```

???
