## Content

Lua is a **lightweight, fast, and versatile** programming language. It was created in Brazil in 1993 and is currently maintained by a team of developers at PUC-Rio, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro.

One of the main features of Lua is its **extensibility**. You can use it to extend the functionality of other programs written in C or other languages. This makes it a popular choice for video game scripting, embedded systems, and web development.
