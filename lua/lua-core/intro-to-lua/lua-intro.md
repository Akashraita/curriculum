## Content

Lua is a **lightweight, fast, and versatile** programming language. It was created in Brazil in 1993 and is currently maintained by a team of developers at PUC-Rio, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro.

One of the main features of Lua is its **extensibility**. You can use it to extend the functionality of other programs written in C or other languages. This makes it a popular choice for video game scripting, embedded systems, and web development.

Next to **Extensibility**, here are a few more reasons why you might consider learning Lua:

**Simplicity**: simple and consistent syntax.

**Performance**: fast and efficient, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.

**Community**: A vibrant and supportive community of users and developers.

Overall, Lua is a great language to learn for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Its simplicity, performance, and versatility make it a valuable addition to any programmer's toolbox.
