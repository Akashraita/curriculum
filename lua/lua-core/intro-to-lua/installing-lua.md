# Installing Lua

---
## Content

Here are the steps you need to follow to install Lua on your computer:

**Download the Lua interpreter**: The first step is to download the Lua interpreter, which is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the latest version of the interpreter from the [official Lua website](https://www.lua.org/download.html).

**Install the Lua interpreter**: Once you've downloaded the Lua interpreter, you'll need to install it on your computer. The installation process will vary depending on your operating system.

**Test the installation**: After you've installed the Lua interpreter, you can test it by running the `lua` command in your terminal or command prompt. If Lua is installed correctly, you should see the Lua prompt (>) appear. You can then enter Lua code and see it executed.

**Note**: If you do not want to install the interpreter, you can use their [live demo](https://www.lua.org/demo.html) to test some code or view their demo programs.
