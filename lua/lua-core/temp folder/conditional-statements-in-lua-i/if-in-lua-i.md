# if Statements

---
## Content

In Lua, the `if` statement is used for conditional execution of code. It allows you to **test a condition** and **execute code if the condition is true**, otherwise, execute another block of code.

The basic syntax for an `if` statement is as follows:
```lua
if condition then
   -- code to execute if condition is true
end
```
