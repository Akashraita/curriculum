# Booleans

---

## Content

A **boolean** is a **logical value** that can be **either true or false**. 

You can create a boolean variable *using the true and false keywords*.

> `true` and `false` must be lowercase!

Here's an example of creating a boolean variable in Lua:
```lua
bool1 = true
bool2 = false
```

> Remember that Lua is **case-sensitive**, meaning that `True` is not the same as `true`, nor is `False` the same as `false`.
