# Numbers

---
## Content

**Number** data types **supports both integer[1] and floating-point[2]** numbers. 

Using variables, you can perform a wide variety of mathematical operations with them.

Here's an example of creating an integer and float variable:

```lua
integer = 42
float = 42.0
print(integer)
```

> Note that you can create and assign values to multiple variables on the same line:

```lua
num1, num2 = 1, 2
print(num1, num2)
-- 1 2
```

---
## Practice

Write a Lua program that creates a `my_number` variable and prints its value to the console.

```lua
??? = 42
???(my_number)  
```

- `my_number`
- `print`
- `write`
- `myNumber`


---
## Revision

Create a variable called `num` and set it to `31`.

```lua
??? ??? ???
```

- `num`
- `=`
- `31`
