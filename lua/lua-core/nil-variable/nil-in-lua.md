# Nil Value

## Content

**Nil** is a special data type in Lua that **represents the absence of a value**. 

If a variable is set to `nil`, it means that **it has no value**. You can set a variable to `nil` using the `nil` keyword.

Here's an example of setting a variable to nil in Lua:

```lua
my_variable = nil
```
