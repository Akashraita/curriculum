# Releasing Memory

---
## Content



### Releasing memory

When a variable is set to `nil`, it **releases any associated memory**, allowing Lua to **use that memory for other purposes**. 

This can be useful for managing memory in programs with large datasets or long-running processes.

> For instance, **clearing sensitive data** such as passwords.
