# Resetting a Variable

---

## Content

There are various scenarios where setting a variable to `nil` can be useful.

For instance, setting a variable to `nil` can be a way to **reset a variable to a neutral state**, especially if it's used in a loop or needs to be reinitialized frequently.

For instance, a game can be coded to recognize whether a variable is changed, which would result in different behavior.

```lua
-- Check if the game state is neutral
if gameState == nil then
    print("Game state is neutral.")
else
    print("Game state is not neutral.")
end
```
