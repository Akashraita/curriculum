# Number of Length of Operator I

---

## Content

In Lua, you can use the `#` operator to find the length of a string.

For example, to find the length of a string `my_string`, you would use:
```lua
my_string = "hello world"
print(#my_string) --> 11
```

When checking the length of a string, it is **determined by the number of characters**. Thus, **white spaces are also counted**.


---

## Practice

Fill in the gaps to find the length of the `str` string:
```lua
??? = "hello world"
print(???) --> 11
```

- `str`
- `#str`
- `string`
- `$string`


---

## Revision


```lua
string = "Counting Game!!"
print(#string) 
```
In the code above, ??? will be printed in the terminal when it runs.
