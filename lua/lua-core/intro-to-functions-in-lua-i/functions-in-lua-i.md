# Intro to Functions in Lua

---

## Content

Functions are one of the most important concepts in Lua programming. 

A function is a **block of code that performs a specific task** and can be **called from other parts of the program**. Functions are *used to organize and reuse code*, making your programs more *modular and easier to maintain*.

To help you understand, functions are like specialized doctors in a hospital. When you encounter a specific illness, you would *call* on these specialized doctors and have them carry out specialized treatments.
