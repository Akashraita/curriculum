# Lua in Games

---
## Content

Lua is often used in the development of video games as a scripting language to allow for dynamic behavior of game objects, game logic, and other game-related events. It is often used as an embedded scripting language in game engines such as Unity, Corona SDK, and Love2D.

One example of the usefulness of Lua in a game can be seen in the popular game World of Warcraft. Lua scripts are used extensively in World of Warcraft to allow players to customize their user interface, automate tasks, and create add-ons to enhance their gameplay experience.

Players can write scripts that modify their game's user interface, automate repetitive tasks, and create customized alerts and notifications for various in-game events. This allows players to tailor their game experience to their preferences, making it more enjoyable and efficient.

Lua is also used in other games for various purposes, such as defining game rules, controlling AI behavior, and implementing dynamic events. For example, in the game Garry's Mod, Lua scripts are used to create custom game modes, modify the game's physics engine, and create custom player models and weapons.
