# Building our Addon

## Content

Now that we have a new Lua file in your `addon` folder, let's add some code to create the script.

First, let's create some empty functions that we will fill in later:
```lua
-- Function to show the spell alert
function showSpellAlert(spellName)
  -- Code to show the spell alert
end

-- Function to hide the spell alert
function hideSpellAlert()
  -- Code to hide the spell alert
end

-- Function to check the cooldown status of a spell
function checkCooldown(spellName)
  -- Code to check the spell cooldown 
end
```

We name these functions based on their funtionality.

In the next insight, let's add some code to these functions.
