# Why It's Good to Learn R

---

## Content


**R** is a powerful and popular programming language that is widely used in data science, statistics, and research. Here are a few reasons why it's a good idea to learn **R**:

It's widely used in academia and industry: **R** is a popular choice for statistical analysis and data visualization in many fields, including economics, biology, psychology, and finance. This means that learning **R** can make you a valuable asset to employers and can open up career opportunities in a variety of industries.

It has a large and active community: **R** has a large and active community of users and developers, which means that there is a wealth of resources and support available for learning and using **R**. There are numerous forums, blogs, and online communities where you can ask questions, get help, and share your knowledge with others.

It has a wide range of packages and tools: **R** has a vast collection of packages and tools that extend its functionality and make it suitable for a wide range of tasks. For example, there are packages for machine learning, data manipulation, data visualization, and more.

It's a good foundation for learning other languages: Many other programming languages, such as Python and Java, share some similarities with **R**. Learning **R** can therefore be a good foundation for learning these other languages, making it easier to pick up new skills in the future.

## Practice

Let's try some **R** code! Can you write a function that takes a vector of numbers and returns the sum of the squares of those numbers?

```r
sum_of_squares <- function(x) {
  ???
}

```

- sum(x^2)
- x^2 %>% sum
- reduce(x, +, x^2)
- x %>% sapply(function(n) n^2) %>% sum
