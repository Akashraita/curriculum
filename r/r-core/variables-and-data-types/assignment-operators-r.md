# Assignment Operators in R

---

## Content

In R, you can use assignment operators to assign values to variables.

The most common assignment operator is the `<-` operator, which is used to assign a value to a variable:
```r
x <- 5
y <- 10

print(x)
# 5

print(y)
# 10
```

You can also use the `=` operator, but it is generally recommended to use `<-` as it is easier to read and less prone to errors.

```r
x = 5
y = 10

print(x)
# 5

print(y)
# 10
```
