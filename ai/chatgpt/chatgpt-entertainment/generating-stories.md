# Generating Stories

Now, let's see how we can generate stories in different styles.

Here's an example of a story with less than 200 words that rhyme in Eminems style:

Then, we tell it to generate the same one, but in the style of a pirate:

Then we switch it up from a pirate style to a more children suitable story:
