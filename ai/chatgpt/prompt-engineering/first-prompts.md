# First Prompts!

---

## Content

---

First thing to keep in mind, the more precise we are with our prompts, the more precise the output will be.

Which means, the more context we provide it, the easier it is for the AI to know what we mean and produce a more accurate result.

For instance, here's an example of a vague prompt:

![orange-prompt](https://img.enkipro.com/12b85f64fb01e8ddd41d45eeeaf377b3.png)

"Orange" can be both a color and a fruit. Since we didn't specify what we mean, the ai assumed we meant fruit and gave a brief description of what an orange is.

Here's another example where we give it more context:

![orange-color](https://img.enkipro.com/d36d09ecb169dacd5a9804039b07876d.png)

The difference between these two is, one is a single word prompt that can mean more than 1 thing, so the ai has to assume in order to give an answer. Whereas in the other one, we clearly state we want the description of the color orange, so it gives a more accurate response.

To summarize, the quality of the output is largely dependent on the quality of the input.
