# Prompt Techniques

There are several prompting techinques used for training or guiding an ai to perform tasks by providing adequate context and examples.

Three useful techiques are called **few-shot** prompting, **zero-shot** prompting and **chain-of-thought** prompting.

**Few-shot** prompting referes to giving an ai a limited number of examples and expecting it to perform a task correctly on new, unseen inputs.

**Zero-shot** prompting doesn't rely on examples. It is expected from the AI to understand and execute a task based on the given textual description. The model is expected to use its pre-existing knowledge.

**Chain-of-thought** prompting is a technique where the AI model generates a sequence of coherent responses to achieve a specific goal or complete a task.  This method encourages the model to maintain context throughout a series of prompts, simulating a more natural thought process. 

We will dive into some examples on each of these in the following insights.
