# OpenAI Chat vs Playground

---

## Content

---

**OpenAI** Chat and **OpenAI** Playground are both tools that use **OpenAI**'s language models, but they serve different purposes.

**OpenAI** Chat is a chatbot that can be integrated with various messaging or chat applications, such as **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, or **Discord**. It allows users to interact with the language model in a conversational manner by sending messages or prompts and receiving responses in real-time.

On the other hand, **OpenAI** Playground is a web-based interface that provides users with a more structured environment to experiment with **OpenAI**'s language models. It allows users to input prompts or questions and receive a response from the model, as well as to tweak various parameters to fine-tune the output.

While both tools use **OpenAI**'s language models, **OpenAI** Chat is more suitable for real-time interactions, such as customer support or personal assistance, while **OpenAI** Playground is more suitable for experimentation, testing, or research purposes. Depending on your needs, you can choose the tool that best fits your use case.

Throughout this course, we will be using the **OpenAI** chat.
