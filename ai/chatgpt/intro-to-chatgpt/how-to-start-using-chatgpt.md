# How to Start using ChatGPT

---

## Content

---

To start using **ChatGPT**, there are a few platforms you can choose from. One option is **OpenAI's GPT-3** Playground, which you can access [here](https://platform.openai.com/playground). Alternatively, you can use an application that integrates with **ChatGPT**, such as OpenAI's chat/messaging app [here](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

Once you've decided on a platform, you'll need to sign up or log in to your account. The Playground requires an OpenAI API key, which you can obtain by signing up for **OpenAI's GPT-3** beta program. If you're using a messaging or chat app, you may need to create an account or add **ChatGPT** as a bot or integration.

Once you're logged in, you can start interacting with **ChatGPT** by entering prompts and waiting for responses. Keep in mind that **ChatGPT**'s capabilities and limitations may vary depending on the platform you're using and the prompts you give it. 

As you experiment with **ChatGPT**, you'll likely discover new ways to make the most of this powerful AI tool.
