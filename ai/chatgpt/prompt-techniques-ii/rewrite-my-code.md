Did you know ChatGPT can rewrite your code for you?

Here's an example:

Here are a few more examples:
![async-await](https://img.enkipro.com/718cbdb6bac3c1ff84cf4f3bee773dd7.png)

![arrow-function](https://img.enkipro.com/807d78d5cfe4d1f8bcf119f85d27fa81.png)

We can also use tell it to simplify:

or optimize your code:

As you can see from the above examples, a single different keyword can make the output differ.
