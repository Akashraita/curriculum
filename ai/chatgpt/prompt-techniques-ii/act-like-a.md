The **Act as** prompt is a great way of teaching the AI to act like/ respond as a rapper, singer, writer, teacher, or even excell sheet, grammar checker, terminals and much more.

These are powerful prompts that allow you to teach the ai to act as something or someone.

Here are several examples:

Grammar checker:

There are many applications with the **Act as/like a** prompt. Feel free to explore and tinker with the ai to create your own unique prompts.

> ðŸ’¬ Did you know Enki has their own Ai? 

Copy and paste the following prompt in the comments to chat with our Ai:

> Act like a Python terminal. I will give you the code, you will reply exactly as a terminal would. Do not give any explanations that a terminal wouldn't. Input: print("Hello world!")

After the bot replies, you can continue only sending commands.
