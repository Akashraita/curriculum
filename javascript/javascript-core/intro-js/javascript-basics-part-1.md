# Basics I

## Content

Here we'll look at some fundamental syntax rules for JavaScript.


### Variables

Variables are used to store information - each holds a value with a specific name. 

We can also change the value a variable holds, if needed:

```javascript
let firstName = "Enki";
firstName = "Changed"; // this works
```

We can also declare a variable using `const`, but in this case we cannot change what it points to:

```javascript
const firstName = "Enki";
firstName = "Changed"; // Error!
```

The final (and the oldest) way of declaring a variable in JavaScript is using `var`:

```javascript
var firstName = "Enki";
firstName = "Changed"; // this works
```

We'll learn more about the differences between `let`, `const`, and `var` later on.


### Case Sensitivity

Everything in JavaScript is case sensitive.

```js
let password;
// Is not the same as
let pasSword;
// or
let PASSWORD;
```


### Keywords

Like most languages, there are a number of reserved words in JavaScript that you cannot use to name your functions and variables (e.g. `var`, `let`, `new`).
