# Variables


---

## Content

Variables are used to store information - each holds a value with a specific name. 

We can also change the value a variable holds, if needed:

```javascript
let firstName = "Enki";
firstName = "Changed"; // this works
```

We can also declare a variable using `const`, but in this case we cannot change what it points to:

```javascript
const firstName = "Enki";
firstName = "Changed"; // Error!
```

The final (and the oldest) way of declaring a variable in JavaScript is using `var`:

```javascript
var firstName = "Enki";
firstName = "Changed"; // this works
```

We'll learn more about the differences between `let`, `const`, and `var` later on.

> ðŸ’¡ If you're unsure what a variable is, check out the [variables lesson](https://app.enki.com/insights/programs-and-data) in our [Coding Intro](https://app.enki.com/skill/coding-intro) topic.
