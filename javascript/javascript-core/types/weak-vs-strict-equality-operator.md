# Weak vs Strict equality operator


---

## Content

In JavaScript, there are two ways to check if values equal each other.

### Weak Typing `==`

The operator `==` coerces (converts) types before comparing the terms. Using `==` to compare two values will first force the values to have the same type before comparing them:

```js
// a number 2
let x = 2; 

// a string '2'
let y = '2';

// are equal when
// using == because
// they are both
// first converted
// to numbers before
// comparing
console.log(
  x == y // true
);
```

> ðŸ’¡ The **weak equality operator** (`==`) is also refered to as **loose** or **abstract**.

### Strict Typing `===`

The strict equality operator `===` works as `==`, but without type coercion. Using `===` will require us to match both the type and the value:

```js
// a number 2
let x = 2; 

// a string '2'
let y = '2';

// when using ===
// any values that
// have a different
// type are always
// not equal
console.log(
  x === y // false
);
```

Using `==` is generally considered bad practice as it could lead to bugs in the code.

## Practice

Match the type name with the operator:

```plain-text
==  - ???
=== - ???
```

Fill in the gaps with the correct equality operator to get the output:

```js
"19" ??? 19
// true

"nk" ??? "nk"
// true
```

[1: Hints]

Weak equality operators can cause difficult-to-locate bugs due to unexpected type conversions.
